A man named Jerry was going through a desert. He was naive yet greedy. The desert was warming as if all the heaters in the world were working together to heat it up. Jerry and his fellow camel were going through the plains. There was only soft, warm yellowish-brown sand around them. Jerry started to feel thirsty. So, he took out his water vessel and drank up all of what was left. 
They kept on walking and walking. After a few minutes; maybe hours of walking, they came to a halt. Jerry had been carrying not one but ten extra bottles of water. Each had a capacity of at least three liters. Of course, it would’ve been hard for Jerry to carry all of them. He carried maximum one and rest was carried by the poor camel. Jerry came up to camel to switch the vessels. Almost all felt light except only one which felt heavier compared to others.
Jerry continued his journey. After a period of two to three days, Jerry had almost reached his destination. He only had a compass to locate the place. He took out the water vessel again, only half a quarter of water was left. As anyone would expect, he also drank up the last few drops of water. He was only thinking about the money he would get by doing the work.
Few minutes passed by. By then, the town must’ve arrived. It didn’t. The path only seemed to continue and never end. Jerry, now too tired, climbed up the camel somehow. He was in bulky suit too. Camel was slow but moving. Jerry started to feel unconscious and need of water. 
Then out of nowhere, where it should’ve been impossible, Jerry saw a shiny trail of water. He put the camel to halt and ran to the water. As soon as he reached the water body, there was no water to be seen for miles. Jerry was so disappointed and confused at the same time. Was this an act of God? 
Maybe not he thought. He went up the camel again. After almost an hour. He finally arrived at the town. He tied his camel and took out the bag of items he was transporting.
Dead inside, Jerry somehow reached the merchant. “What happened to you? See your condition!”, said the merchant. “My lord, it is because of deficiency of water”, Jerry said with his dry lips. Merchant offered some meal and cool drinks. He also gave some to Jerry’s camel.
“I saw an impossible deed. A water body that can be seen but doesn’t exist.”, Jerry said.
“You fool! It was the reflection of light. I have noticed it many times. Anyways, you can stop in the town for a few days. I will contact your client and tell him that all the items were transported.”, Merchant said.
“Thank you, my lord. It means a lot to me.”, ended Jerry. 
Jerry then stopped in the town for a week or two and left off to his familiar places. He then became generous and prospered a lot. 
Then he was known for his water transport facilities and planted several handpumps around deserts sothat no one has to face a problem like him anymore. Hence, he became one of the most generous mayors of his town.

-The End-
